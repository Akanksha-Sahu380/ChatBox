# üí¨ Offline Chat Reply Recommendation System using Transformers

This project builds an **offline chat-reply recommendation system** that predicts the next possible reply from *User A* when *User B* sends a message ‚Äî using previous conversation history as context.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

The system uses **Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, GPT, or T5)** fine-tuned on two-person conversation datasets to generate or recommend contextually appropriate replies.

### üß† Objective
- Train a transformer model to predict **User A‚Äôs next message** based on **User B‚Äôs previous message** and conversation history.
- Handle **long conversational data** efficiently using tokenization and attention mechanisms.
- Build an **offline inference setup** (no API calls) for real-time chat assistance.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset

You need two datasets containing long two-person chat conversations.  
Each dataset should follow a format similar to:

| User | Message | Timestamp |
|------|----------|------------|
| A | Hi, how are you? | 10:01 |
| B | I‚Äôm fine, you? | 10:02 |
| A | Doing great! | 10:03 |

> Preprocessing and tokenization scripts handle cleaning, truncation, and context formatting.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Workflow

1. **Preprocessing:**
   - Tokenize chat history
   - Create context‚Äìresponse pairs
   - Limit sequence length using sliding windows

2. **Model:**
   - Base Transformer: BERT / DistilGPT2 / T5
   - Fine-tuned on conversation pairs
   - Loss: Cross-Entropy or Causal LM Loss

3. **Inference:**
   - Takes the last few turns of conversation
   - Predicts top candidate replies
